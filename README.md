--> This repository houses the Activity Streams website at <http://activitystrea.ms/>.

## Special Directories ##

The `registry` directory is auto-generated from the [Activity Streams Registry][registry] repository.  Do not make
changes directly in the `registry` directory.

The specifications in the `head` directory are auto-generated from their various repositories.  Do not edit them 
directly.

The stylesheets in the `css` directory are auto-generated by [compass][], do not edit them directly.  The source files 
are in the `sass` directory.

## Developers ##

For anyone that intends to work on the website, it is recommended that you install [compass][] and [jekyll][].  Then 
open two extra terminal windows and run the following in the root directory of the website.  This will allow your 
changes to be immediately visible in your local development environment.

Run jekyll in one terminal:

    jekyll --server --auto --pygments --safe

Run compass in the other:

    compass watch
