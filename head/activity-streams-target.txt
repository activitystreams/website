1.  Introduction

   The Activity Streams specification defines a format for describing
   socially interesting events, or "Activities", about the people and
   things an individual cares about.

   Every Activity has both a Primary and Secondary audience.  The
   Primary audience consists of those entities either directly involved
   in the activity or who "own" the objects involved.  The Secondary
   audience consists of the collection of entities sharing an interest
   in the activity but who are not directly involved (e.g. "followers").

   For instance, suppose a social network of three individuals: Bob, Joe
   and Jane.  Bob and Joe are each friends with Jane but not friends
   with one another.  Bob has chosen to "follow" activities for which
   Jane is directly involved.  Jane shares a file with Joe.

   In this example, Jane and Joe are each directly involved in the file
   sharing activity and together make up the Primary Audience for that
   event.  Bob, having an interest in activities involving Jane, is the
   Secondary Audience.  Knowing this, a system that produces or consumes
   the activity can more intelligently notify each of the users of the
   event.

   The core Activity Streams specification does not define a means of
   explicitly identifying the Primary or Secondary audience for an
   event.  There are means, based on the verb, actor, object and target
   of the activity, to infer the primary audience for many types of
   activities, but not all.  This specification introduces four optional
   extension properties for an Activity to explicitly describe the
   Primary and Secondary audience.  An activity utilizing these
   extension properties is hereafter referred to as a "Targeted
   Activity".

2.  Notational Conventions

   The text of this specification provides the sole definition of
   conformance.  Examples in this specification are non-normative.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Targeting Properties

   The "to", "cc", "bto" and "bcc" properties MAY be used within an
   Activity to identify the Primary and Secondary audiences.  The value
   of each of these properties when serialized using the JSON format is
   an array of Activity Streams Objects.  The objects can be of any
   object type but will typically represent individuals or groups of
   individuals.

   | Property  | Value         | Description                           |

3.1.  Public and Private Audiences

   The prototypical use case for Targeted Activities is the publication
   and redistribution of Activities through an intermediary.  A event
   source generates the activity and publishes it to the intermediary
   which determines which subset of events to display to specific
   individual users.  Such a determination can be made, in part, by
   identifying the Primary and Secondary Audiences for the activity.

   When the event source generates the activity and specifies values for
   the "to" and "cc" fields, the intermediary SHOULD redistribute that
   event with the values of those fields intact, allowing any entity
   receiving and processing that entity to see who the activity has been
   targeted to.  This is precisely that same model used by the to and cc
   fields in email systems.

   There are situations, however, in which disclosing the identity of
   specific members of the audience may be inappropriate.  For instance,



Snell                   Expires September 2, 2011               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               ActivityStreams                  March 2011


   a user may not wish to let other users know that they are interested
   in various topics, individuals or types of events.  To support this
   option, an event source generating an activity MAY use the "bto" and
   "bcc" properties to list entities to whom the activity should be
   privately targeted.  When the intermediary receives an activity
   containing these properties, it MUST remove them prior to
   redistributing the activity.  The intermediary MAY insert new "bto"
   and "bcc" property values containing empty arrays as an indication
   that a private audience exists without disclosing the specific
   individual members of that private audience.

   The following example illustrates the expected behavior of an
   intermediary redistributing an activity that has both a public and
   private audience:

   First, the event source generates an activity that is published to
   the intermediary.

     {
       "to":[
         {"objectType":"person",
          "id":"tag:example.org,2011:jane"}
       ],
       "bto":[
         {"objectType":"person",
          "id":"tag:example.org,2011:joe"}
       ],
       "cc":[
         {"objectType":"person",
          "id":"tag:example.org,2011:bob"}
       ],
       "bcc":[
         {"objectType":"person",
          "id":"tag:example.org,2011:lisa"}
       ],
       "verb":"post",
       "actor":{
         "objectType":"person",
         "id":"tag:example.org,2011:jane"},
       "object":{
         ...
       }
     }

   Upon receiving the activity, the intermediary will generate a
   modified copy of the activity that omits the "bto" and "bcc" values
   and will make that activity available to each of the four people
   identified.
